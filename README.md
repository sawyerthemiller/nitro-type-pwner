I did this because, after they switched to a subscription method, they refused to honor my lifetime gold I had previously bought...

# Disclaimer
This mod re-adds the “General Beauregard” car purely for nostalgia and preservation purposes. The original asset includes imagery associated with the Confederate flag, which I do not support or endorse in any way whatsoever. This content is included only to retain historical accuracy of older Nitro Type assets, not to promote the symbolism or ideology tied to it. You may of course, delete the parts that do this.

# Cosmetics
The mod adds two new cars (The Griswold Family Truckster, and General Beauregard) to the game. Any modifications done are purely client side and may not be able to be used server sided. Exploits like that existed long ago, but were closed shortly after made public. All mods are done purely through CSS or JS, and unlike the previous 'data injection' method found in other scripts, should be permanent as long as the scripts are kept on. 

About the old data injection method, it still does work, but is very fickle, sometimes needs multiple page restarts to fix, and even then only lasts for a split second in most cases...

# Requirements for Chrome or Firefox
1. Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey or Greasemonkey
2. Stylebot
3. UBO Extension with [this list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sawyerthemiller/the-clean-web/refs/heads/main/filter.ubo)

This mod attempts to remove ads from the page, but it is always recommended you browse the internet with an adblocker. Thats not my words, that's the U.S. Government words lol. Stay safe and have fun.

To set a custom user tag, edit the tampermonkey script. To enable gold and the cosmetic mods, paste in the styles.css part

!! It is also recommended you use the [**Nitro Type Admin Panel**](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/537263-nitro-type-admin-panel)
 Script with one of the afformentioned extensions. It lets you unlock every car in the game, and race with them !!
